        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li class="step">
            Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two
            20cm/8in sandwich tins.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            To make the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the
            boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or
            electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until
            smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the
            oven for 25–35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a
            skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still
            in their tins, before icing.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            To make the chocolate ganache, heat the chocolate and cream in a
            saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan
            from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and
            thickened. Set aside to cool for 1–2 hours, or until thick enough to
            spread over the cake.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of
            the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from
            the tins.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            Spread a little chocolate ganache over the top of one of the
            chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.
          </li>
          <li class="step">
            Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with
            the chocolate ganache, using a palette knife.
